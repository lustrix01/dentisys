# DentiSys Repository Rules

- DentiSys runs locally through Docker Compose only. Do not add XAMPP, native PHP, native MySQL/MariaDB, or `local.php` runtime paths.
- Keep the stack small: React/Vite, plain PHP with Composer dependencies, PostgreSQL, Mailpit, and optional development-only pgAdmin.
- Do not delete or reuse a persisted database volume without explicit approval. Schema changes are additive, ordered migrations.
- Current sign-in is password plus optional authenticator-app 2FA with recovery codes. Do not reintroduce email-code 2FA.
- Google-only sign-in, configurable multi-domain allowlists, facial biometrics, image publishing, and demonstration deployment are roadmap work unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve existing routes, styles, assets, localStorage keys, roles, and workflows unless the task requires a behavior change.
- Keep secrets out of version control. Docker Compose reads local values from root `.env`; backend runtime configuration comes from container environment variables.
- Avoid unrelated refactors and formatting churn. Keep future image publishing seams lightweight; do not add registry, VPS, TLS, CI/CD, Traefik, Watchtower, or cloud deployment files without approval.
- Before handoff, run `docker compose config --quiet`, `./scripts/check.ps1`, `./scripts/migrate.ps1`, `./scripts/smoke.ps1`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e` when their required services are available.
